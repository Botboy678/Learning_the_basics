# Learning the Basics  

Welcome to **Learning the Basics**! This repository is a personal journey through the fundamentals of data structures, algorithms, and computer science concepts. It serves as both a practice ground and a checklist to track my progress as I build a solid foundation in problem-solving and software development.  

## What's Inside  
This repo isn't about fully-fledged projects—it's about getting hands-on with the core concepts that make up efficient and effective programming. You’ll find simple implementations, algorithmic exercises, and code snippets demonstrating various techniques and problem-solving strategies.  

## Topics Covered  
- **Algorithmic Complexity:** Understanding Big-O and asymptotic analysis.  
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and more.  
- **Algorithmic Techniques:** Binary search, bitwise operations, recursion, dynamic programming.  
- **Trees and Graphs:** Traversals, balanced trees, heaps, and graph representations.  
- **Sorting Algorithms:** From simple insertion and selection sorts to efficient mergesort and quicksort.  
- **Advanced Concepts:** Design patterns, combinatorics, floating-point numbers, networking, and more.  
- **Job Preparation:** Resume building, interview preparation, and post-interview strategies.  

## Progress Tracking  
I'll be keeping track of my progress using a separate `progress.md` file, where I'll mark off concepts as I gain mastery over them.
